# README: Monte Carlo Analysis of Statistical Physical Models
This repository contains my work on the numerical analysis of the Ising model, focusing on advanced simulation techniques and Monte Carlo algorithms. The aim is to explore critical phenomena, phase transitions, and other physical properties of the Ising model, with a particular emphasis on the two-dimensional axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model.
